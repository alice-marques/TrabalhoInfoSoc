	abstract = {AbstractBackground
The popularity and proliferation of online social networks (OSNs) have created massive social interaction among users that generate an extensive amount of data. An OSN offers a unique opportunity for studying and understanding social interaction and communication among far larger populations now more than ever before. Recently, OSNs have received considerable attention as a possible tool to track a pandemic because they can provide an almost real-time surveillance system at a less costly rate than traditional surveillance systems.
Methods
A systematic literature search for studies with the primary aim of using OSN to detect and track a pandemic was conducted. We conducted an electronic literature search for eligible English articles published between 2004 and 2015 using PUBMED, IEEExplore, ACM Digital Library, Google Scholar, and Web of Science. First, the articles were screened on the basis of titles and abstracts. Second, the full texts were reviewed. All included studies were subjected to quality assessment.
Result
OSNs have rich information that can be utilized to develop an almost real-time pandemic surveillance system. The outcomes of OSN surveillance systems have demonstrated high correlations with the findings of official surveillance systems. However, the limitation in using OSN to track pandemic is in collecting representative data with sufficient population coverage. This challenge is related to the characteristics of OSN data. The data are dynamic, large-sized, and unstructured, thus requiring advanced algorithms and computational linguistics.
Conclusions
OSN data contain significant information that can be used to track a pandemic. Different from traditional surveys and clinical reports, in which the data collection process is time consuming at costly rates, OSN data can be collected almost in real time at a cheaper cost. Additionally, the geographical and temporal information can provide exploratory analysis of spatiotemporal dynamics of infectious disease spread. However, on one hand, an OSN-based surveillance system requires comprehensive adoption, enhanced geographical identification system, and advanced algorithms and computational linguistics to eliminate its limitations and challenges. On the other hand, OSN is probably to never replace traditional surveillance, but it can offer complementary data that can work best when integrated with traditional data.},

In recent years, Cyberbullying has grown into a major problem with the growth of online communication and social media. Cyberbullying has been recognized recently as a serious national health issue among online social network users and developing an efficient detection model holds tremendous practical significance. In this paper, we have proposed set of unique features derived from Twitter; network, activity, user, and tweet content, based on these feature, we developed a supervised machine learning solution for detecting cyberbullying in the Twitter. An evaluation demonstrates that our developed detection model based on our proposed features, achieved results with an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.943 and an f-measure of 0.936. These results indicate that the proposed model based on these features provides a feasible solution to detecting Cyberbullying in online communication environments. Finally, we compare result obtained using our proposed features with the result obtained from two baseline features. The comparison outcomes show the significance of the proposed features.},

	volume = {45},
	abstract = {The constant and rapid investments in Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have allowed the growth in the quality of information response available within the internet which requires considering and addressing the physical, financial, socio-demographic, cognitive, design, institutional, political and cultural types of access. The main purpose of this paper is to revise actual and new emerging ICTs and the use of its application tools in Education which is dominated by the linear paradigm in interaction and information as interactivity is not being accepted as a guiding principle. The concept of e-learning rests on the idea that pedagogy technologically sustained includes enough knowledge with regard to the wishes of learning processes, which are a process of mind embedded in a culture and also challenges and not just concepts. Learning is a process that humans have been trying to master for many centuries. However, there are so many different ways to do the process that it is sometimes very hard to determine which one is the best of a given situation. One such type of learning is heuristic learning. Through this method the students should discover things for themselves, through problem solving, inductive reasoning, or simply by trial and error. Discovering things by yourself, knowing from experience rather than books. In many situations it seems that heuristic learning is the most suitable when one really believes in something when one experiences it himself. That is what heuristic learning is really all about. This type of learning model, in an online format, is tailored to the adult learner who typically has a sense of self-direction related to individual interests, goals, strengths, and previous experience. Also the pedagogical theory of connectivism was born as a response to very fast ICT development which strongly influences education and which approach to problem solving is based on the use of simulation animations, making students change parameters and verify or seek the problem solving, applying their need of intuitive searching by the heuristic method; information is assigned by image without the application of long texts. After a series of simulation experiments, the students verify their results with a calculation and a real experiment.},

La sociedad que nos ofrece Black Mirror se presenta así como una metáfora de la sociedad actual, en la que son exploradas las potenciales transformaciones en la comunicación, sociabilidad y moralidad. Las ideas que se reflejan en Black Mirror son, por otro lado, coincidentes con las ideas expuestas por muchos teóricos sociales de los últimos años del siglo XX y principios del siglo XXI, quienes nos alertan de los cambios sociales y culturales que provocan y posiblemente producirán en el futuro las nuevas tecnologías.},

	title = {Digital alienation as the foundation of online privacy concerns},
	volume = {45},
	abstract = {The term 'digital alienation' is used in critical IS research to refer to manifestations of alienation online. This paper explores the difficulties of using a traditional Marxist analysis to account for digital alienation. The problem is that the activity people undertake online does not look coerced or estranged from the creator's individuality, both of which are typically seen as necessary for the production of alienation. As a result of this apparent difficulty, much of the research has focused on the relationship between digital alienation and digital labour.

This paper attempts to overcome these difficulties by discarding the traditional approach. We argue one can better understand digital alienation by focusing on the relationship between user intent and technical infrastructure, rather than concerns with labour. Under the existing economic model dominating the internet, free services are financed by recording user activity and then using the products of this commercial surveillance to sell information about people to others. We show how the real harm in current online business models is that commercial surveillance is being used to commodify private life.

Seeking to define personal data in more precise terms, we will introduce two new concepts necessary for a detailed discussion of any ethical issues regarding personal data - the digital shadow and the digital persona. We will then show how affordances in current online systems are tuned to commodification of the user's personality. We will then explore the nature of online surveillance and show how affordances combine with the surveillance economy to produce digital alienation.},

Cybercrime, one of the most important security topics, will continue to emerge as a more critical security threat within the next years. Among the different attacks, phishing is of special interest because of its negative impact for the economy. In this paper, we develop a simulation study based on the work of Fultz and Grossklags. To extend their analysis of cybercrime by an economic view, we customized their model and used it as basis for our analysis. Based on the data from recent literature, our assessment gives insights into the perpetrator's behavior and allows us to quantify the effectiveness of countermeasures. Due to the fact that mainly risk-seeking persons are responsible for these attacks, countermeasures aiming at increasing the penalties are not very effective. We discovered that better control of dark markets to prevent the trading of stolen data has a much higher impact. In general, results of our simulation can be used to analyze the perpetrator's economic motives and to establish a basis for effective countermeasures.},

	title = {Friends, robots, citizens?},
	volume = {45},
	abstract = {This paper asks whether and how an artefact, such as a robot, could be considered a citizen. In doing so, it approaches questions of political freedom and artefacts. Three key notions emerge in the discussion: discursivity, embodiment and recognition. Overall, discussion of robot citizenship raises technical, political and philosophical problems.

Whereas machine intelligence is hotly debated, machine citizenship is less so. However, much research and activity is underway that seeks to create robot companions, capable of meaningful and intimate relationships with humans. The EU flagship "Robot Companions for Citizens" project aims for "...an ecology of sentient machines that will help and assist humans in the broadest possible sense to support and sustain our welfare."

This is a broad and ambitious aim, with a goal of making artefacts that can have genuine relationships with humans. This being so, in order to avoid merely creating highly interactive automata, the status of the robot must be carefully considered. Without significant public freedoms, for instance, the notion of a robot 'friend' would be a dubious one -- as dubious as the notion of a 'willing slave', for instance. In a broad sense, these issues relate to the politics of robot kinship and sociality, perhaps specifically to civic epistemology. With a technological ideal of genuine human-artefactual kinship in the future, these political questions cannot be ignored. One approach to this problematic involves accounting for the robot citizen.},

	volume = {45},
	abstract = {Responsible research and innovation (RRI) is taking a role to assist all types of stakeholders including industry to move research and innovation initiatives to responsible manner for tackling grand challenges. The literature on RRI focuses little on how industry can implement RRI principles. In solving such gap in the literature, this article constructs a solid framework that provides a conceptual starting point for future research on levels of RRI. It draws a fundamental path to align industrial activities with environmental and societal needs. The framework develops a normatively grounded conceptual path for managing and assessing RRI principles in industry. This study depicts five successive RRI implementation stages and exhibits three RRI dimensions that represent different categories and corresponding indicators for that. The rationale behind this framework has been derived from extant models of corporate social responsibility (CSR) literature. Drawing on these models, this study develops stages and dimensions of RRI for discussing why industry should become engaged in RRI, how industry can embed RRI principles into research and innovation processes, how companies progress from one RRI stage to another, and how industry can manage all RRI dimensions systematically.},

This paper takes in particular the context of Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) as the phenomenon and investigates on how to apply the methodologies, which could assist us to identify the boundaries between societal and ethical issues and the emerging ICTs. As such, to interpret the collected data and build theory inductively, to have an excellent basis for further qualitative research within RRI context, systematic procedures are needed to conduct. This paper uses a holistic view to the literature for providing guidelines for conducting and reporting case study research for RRI context. It defines the information that needs to be gathered from the cases, the way this data is to be analyzed and the processes of reflections to be undertaken. Checklists for conducting the case study protocol are linked to each step of systematic procedures and applicable for researchers, ICT managers, reviewers, and readers to allow them taking account of societal and ethical aspects, in particular RRI principles in emerging ICTs in a proper way.},

This paper aims to critically reassess established approaches to the teaching and analysis of computer ethics, and to propose a revised methodology, drawing on the practical experience of teaching undergraduates in a culturally diverse, international learning environment. Design/methodology/approach ? Theoretical in scope, reviewing concepts and methods in the existing literature and developing an alternative inter-disciplinary and multi-dimensional framework. Findings ? Ethical analysis can benefit from broader, inter-disciplinary perspectives that take into account the social and economic context in which information and communication technologies (ICTs) are designed, deployed and used, and the complex forces that drive their development. A richer analysis of this context enables a better understanding of the specific properties and applications of ICTs which, in turn, foreground particular ethical issues. This can result in a more self-reflexive and rounded appreciation of the ethical, legal and professional issues invoked by ICTs. Originality/value ? The paper develops a revised, flexible methodology for doing ethics which can be applied to any case study or domain of application. It outlines some of the key questions and major ethical principles that are generated by ICTs. The paper has pedagogical value for both teachers and students of computer ethics, but has relevance also for information technology professionals and practitioners.},

	abstract = {This Article directs scholarly and regulatory attention to an overlooked sub-category within online and mobile entities that offer financial services – big data and social netbanks. Recently, big data companies like Google, Amazon and Apple, as well as social networks like Facebook and Twitter, have been making forays into the financial services market, capitalizing on their massive troves of user data and social information. Providing the first in-depth study of big data and social netbanks, this Article analyzes these players’ entry into the financial services market and surveys the current regulatory framework for those new bank-like entities.

Despite the large numbers of technology companies offering financial services and their massive pool of subscribers, regulation of online nonbanks currently consists of a hodgepodge of statutes and regulations. In particular, as this Article shows, existing regulation does not differentiate between this recently emerging form of bank-like services and other online/mobile nonbanks. As big data and social netbanks increasingly eat at the edges of the traditional banking market, this Article makes a key descriptive contribution by presenting a comprehensive analysis of the new entrants. This Article also makes a significant normative contribution by listing the distinctive characteristics of big data and social netbanks and other issues that regulators should be mindful of when designing an appropriate regulatory scheme. These characteristics and issues include consumers’ access to financial services, social consequences, competition in the financial market, cybersecurity, privacy, and specific consumers’ rights.},
